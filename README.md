# TakeScreenshotWinForms (by WhizTech)

This code fixes the “Upper-Left-Part” problem caused by Windows Zoom Scaling, where only a part of the screen is displayed and not the whole screen.

This code is freely accessible to everyone and can be used.

If necessary, the code must be adapted to the program, otherwise errors may occur.

## Windows Scale (Percent in Decimal):
100% = 1,<br>
125% = 1.25,<br>
150% = 1.5,<br>
175% = 1.75,<br>
200% = 2,<br>
225% = 2.25
